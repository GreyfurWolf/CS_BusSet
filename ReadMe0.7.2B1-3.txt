This type list is not final and more will be added later.

One of the main aims is to provide the best gameplay for both players that love realism and those that prefer custom-colored vehicles. The set supports 2CC company colors. The logics of the set is to use CC1 as colors for local-lines and CC2 for regional. Each vehicle is bought with a realistic livery, refits can be used to recolor the vehicle into a CC livery, or other realistic liveries (if available).

There are four types of usage of the vehicle:
Local lines - usually body with more entrance doors, thus faster cargo loading, quicker cargo aging, due to low comfort.
Regional lines - slower cargo loading, medium cargo aging
Long distance lines - slow cargo loading, slow cargo aging
Mail transport

The various fuel types are also somewhat implemented - running costs are the highest for petrol powered buses, diesel ones are cheaper, but natural gas buses are the cheapest. 

Balancing is done through the running cost, price in the shop, the relibility drop, cargo aging. The balancing in the set is basic and can be a subject of changes.
